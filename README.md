## Questions

Do we use pandas?
Do we use concurrency?

## The plan so far

0/ ✅ Create the repo
1/ scrape Immovlan, using concurrency
  
    Problem : requests don't seem to work
      
2/ Get the data and use using pandas.
  
3/ Clean up and write the data (csv > no empty rows, boolean values)
  
4/ Pimp the readme for presentation
